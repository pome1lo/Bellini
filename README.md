## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture**

PSSIG utilizes a **three-layer architecture** to ensure scalability, maintainability, and flexibility:

1. **Data Access Layer (DAL)**:
   - Uses Entity Framework for data modeling and MS SQL Server for persistent storage.
   
2. **Business Logic Layer (BLL)**:
   - Contains core services such as game management, user profiles, statistics, and notifications.
   - Implements caching using Redis to optimize performance.
   
3. **Presentation Layer**:
   - RESTful API built with ASP.NET Core Web API.
   - Frontend developed with **React TypeScript** and **Shadcn UI**.

**API Gateway** and **nginx** handle routing and ensure secure access to the microservices.
